# AmazonPriceFetcher
Python script to automaticly receive the price and title of an amazon product


How to run this py-script at startup:

  Step 1:
  Use an ordinary text-editor to create a .bat file
  (I suggest Notepad++)

  Step 2:
  Create a new file in Notepad++ (name it as you like)

  Step 3:
  copy this:⬇️

  @echo off
  "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe"
  "C:\PyCharmProjects\amazonPriceFetcher\main.py"
  pause

  Step 4:
  Change the first String to your python.exe path
  Change the second String to the path where you saved the main.py file

  Step 5:
  Save the file as a .bat file

  Step 6:
  Use [WIN + R] and write 
  $ shell:startup
  
  Step 7:
  Copy your newly created .bat file into the startup folder
  
  Congrats, the py-script should run automatically after your pc boots
